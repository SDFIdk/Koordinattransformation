 * Wrapper for @function window.fetch
 * This function overwrites fetch to retry in case of a 5xx-based error-code. 
 * It is intended to add stability to koordinattransformation, in case webproj, gsearch or another dependency of the site becomes unreliable
 * Solution is based on: https://www.fabiofranchino.com/log/how-to-override-fetch-in-javascript-to-intercept-it/
 * @param {Array} args  (same args as fetch: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)
